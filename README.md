## 🆕 Improvements in this version

Based on the FA-1 storyboard and review feedback:

- Rebuilt the interface to match the storyboard flow: **Welcome → Age & Goal → Home Dashboard → Logging → Mascot Milestones → New Day / Reset**
- Added the **2-litre bottle** that fills as water is logged
- Made logging **interactive** with fill animation, drip effect and toast messages
- Added mascot **Wick** to every main screen, with milestone reactions
- Applied the storyboard **colour palette**: `#C8E6C9` `#F5EBE0` `#B3E5FC` `#37474F`
- Added **age-aware** goals with an adjustable slider
- Added a **reset confirmation** and automatic **daily reset**
- Replaced the deprecated `use_container_width` setting with `width="stretch"`
- Verified the code compiles and keeps all progress in `st.session_state`
- All graphics are **original inline SVG/CSS**: no copyrighted images, characters or external assets

- Replaced the drop mascot with the **turtle Wick** (walk cycle speed follows hydration)
- Added **daily streak tracker**, quick-sip chips (100/250/500/custom), stat tiles and a sip history list
- New animated background, glass cards and scene

## 🧰 Tech

- **Python** – calculations, conditions and data handling
- **Streamlit** – buttons, sliders, pop-up dialogs, layout and cloud deployment
- **SVG + CSS animation** – bottle, waves, drip and mascot (replaces the Tkinter/Turtle drawing from the storyboard, with the same logic)
